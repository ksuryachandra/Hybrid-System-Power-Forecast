# Power-Forecast

This repository aims to deliver a project to forecast the power generated by a solar park and a wind farm. A real-time hybrid system is considered and relevant influencing factors are shortlisted using feature selection concepts in data science. This project explores three machine learning algorithms (SVR, RFR, XGB) and one deep learning algorithm (LSTM) to find the best performing algorithm at any given time. The excel sheets contain the plant weather report and respective power generation for one year. 

"Energy Forecasting using AI.ipynb" is the file where the user can enter the dates and load demand on those days to generate a supply-demand graph to view the power forecast. This model can be used in any other plants with minor changes. A clear explanation is provided in the documentation "Hybrid System Power Forecasting". The architecture of the model developed is presented below.
